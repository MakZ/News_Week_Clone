# News_Week_Clone

The main goal of this project is to learn how to use the Bootstrap framework, specifically its responsive design features. We applied the Bootstrap classes to our HTML elements in order to replicate as much as possible the given website (https://web.archive.org/web/20210120125445/https://www.newsweek.com/). Also, we made sure that our layout worked well for different kinds of screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
